## About Me
I am a second-year MURP student in the Transportation Planning concentration but am interesting in housing justice, environmental justice, and labor movements as well. I grew up in the UK but have lived in the US for nearly half of my life moving around fairly often but spending formative years in Minneapolis where I completed my undergraduate studies in history and international relations. After graduating, I spent a year in China teaching before returning to Minneapolis where I was a housing case manager with unhoused folks for nearly three years. I moved to LA to study public policy before deciding that planning was a much better fit. In my free time, I love cycling, playing music, finding all the architectural gems of LA, and attending the local movie theaters in town.

## Course Description and Objectives
My understanding is that this course is providing us the tools to visually represent data through Python which will allow us access to a coding language that can enable other forms of data analysis also. I am pretty new to coding besides a very brief introduction to R but I am eager to make this intimidating language make sense to me so I can use it for spatial data analysis and feel more confident tackling data sets on my own.

## Possible Research Topics
Although this has been studied in LA and elsewhere, I want to look further into the increasing presence of investors in the housing market who often convert single-family homes into rentals. If feasible, I would also want to explore whether the geography of these investment grabs in the housing market aligned with the geography of the foreclosure crisis of 2008 in Southern California. Another topic I am interested in is the relationship between gentrification and transit development.
